Spring Boot Examples
There are basically three ways by which we can wire a bean
1. Automatically(Most Preferd)
   --> It is done by component scanning and autowiring (eg : Profile and Dependency Injection Branch)
2. Java based Configuration (Prefered Over Xml configuration)
   --> This Branch is on Java based Configuration
3. XML based Configuration

Note: Use Automatic Configuration if u have control over the source code otherwise go for Java based Configuration, go for XML 
configuration in legacy code only.
